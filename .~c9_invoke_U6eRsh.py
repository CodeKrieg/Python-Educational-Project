# We are starting by defining an object (compound_interest)

# Then we are asking for a couple of inputs:
# Initial deposit, rate (which we divide by 100), the number of years (which we add +1), then we are asking for the compund

# We are then printing two strings, year and amount on deposit, the first string also adds space with %21s, just to keep it clean and simple.

# The next important step is to do a loop, we are doing a foor loop
# Then we are asking for the initial deposit amount (in USD)
# We are asking for the rate and then we dividing the rate to 100.0
# After that we are asking for the amount of time
